Python Log parser

Consider the log file engine.log presented in folder Question1. This file contains the logs of the unix process nxengine starting and running.
In the log:
* starting nxengine indicates that the process is starting.
* nxengine is running indicates that the process has started to run.

Write a script (feel free to use any language you are comfortable with; bonus point if itâ€™s not Java) to list how long nxengine takes to start running. Output the result in the following format:

* Start	Cycle: 1 Duration: HH:MM:SS
* Start	Cycle: 2 Duration: HH:MM:SS
* ...
* Start	Cycle: n Duration: HH:MM:SS
